<p>Computer Architecture, for me, means the design and experimentation of
    various aspects of computer organization.</p>

<p>I see computer architecture as a field continuing to make progress in terms
    of energy efficient processors.
    I also see the field continuing to make progress in terms of hardware
    accelerators and more specialized hardware.</p>
